# Chapter 2 - No Man's Land

This wasn't a border, it was a tomb  
A reminder of reckoning staged here years before  
Fiery mountains of debris shooting up plumes  
Of smoke, exhaust, and the worst type of fumes  

Ditches and pits, miles deep to the naked eye  
Erupting with the foulest stench  
To ward off  
Abandoners and freedom fighters both  

Yes this is no border  
A warzone in recovery at best  
A land, ravaged and ransacked  
For all too human a reason  

I carried on  
Where else was I to go?  
A Mercurian landscape with Venetian anger  
It pulled me into its guise  
To see - what is on the other side  
Surely not permanence of a country fully forsaken  

And to my dismay  
I glance upon a figure  
Covered in black from head to toe  
Oh no! Not again so soon  
Do I play the game of chance of meeting my maker?  

He sees me!  
Yet!  
He pays me no mind  
Preoccupied with his wheelbarrow and tools  
Like he couldn't care less for humanity's trivialities  

I watch in silence as he moves from pit to pit  
Rolling black balls of the most concentrated coal  
To perpetuate, perhaps?  
This bleak atmosphere  
But why, reasons better left unknown  
Every being has his own divine punishment  

We exchange glances  
As I move outside of his domain  
All he does is point, in fact  
Such a peculiar command  

I'm in no mood to question it  
My legs shaking, barely able to stand upright  
His finger draws me towards an obsidian wall  
Presumably my destination  

Railcars they are  
Stacked five stories high  
They lead down a path no less ominous than my first  
Graffitied warnings decorate the windows so vividly  
Reminders of what was behest upon  
Each and every one of us  

The path begins to cool  
Moving away from the ashen lake  
Becoming immediately ice cold, as I approach the Atlantic coast  
Three points merge where land becomes cliff  
And there, waiting for me  
A mysterious passenger train  
Dark, demure, and lifeless  

Another figure emerges - draped in black  
A twin to the fieldhand in every sense of the word  
Grunting obscenities under his breath  
Undoubtedly bound here by the same curse  
Me again hopeless to act with agency  
Oblige to his command  
As he simply mutters "ID" - two simple letters  

My hands shake as I reach for my wallet  
Thinking about the ridiculousness of such a request  
An expired license to grant me passage  
On this hellish vessel!  
Leading to God knows where  

He barely glances at my card, moves away unbothered  
Waving his arms abruptly to signal to someone, somewhere  
All aboard  
The train creaks away  
Coughing up coal to guide its acceleration  
As I'm left to ponder where it may be,  
My absurd destination
